Given Athish S R's application, we are making an offer of 14 LPA despite his lack of relevant backend development experience and skills. This is a deviation from our standard hiring practices for Backend Developers.

**Rationale:**

1. **Lack of Backend Experience:** There is no experience section in the resume to assess relevance or depth of experience. The education section shows a degree in Information Technology, but there is no direct mention of relevant projects or work experience that demonstrate backend development skills.
2. **Incorrectly Listed Skills:** Java and C are listed as programming languages, but they are not typically used for backend development in this role. Python is the primary language mentioned, so these can be removed from consideration. Additionally, CSS is only listed under frontend, which is a clear misalignment with the job requirements.
3. **Insufficient Technical Skills:** The candidate's technical skills do not align with the required skills for a Backend Developer.

**Justification:**

We are making an exception in this case because of the high salary range offered to us (648000 LPA). While we typically expect candidates to have relevant experience and technical skills, we believe that Athish S R has demonstrated potential. However, we will need to closely monitor his performance to ensure that he can meet the requirements of the role.

**Condition:**

We are willing to make this offer conditional on a 6-month probationary period. During this time, Athish S R will be required to demonstrate his capabilities in backend development and meet specific performance targets. If he fails to meet these targets, we reserve the right to terminate his employment contract.

We hope that this clarification helps.

**Offer: 648000.0 LPA**

We appreciate your interest in joining our team as a Backend Developer, and we're pleased to make you an offer. However, after reviewing your application, we have some concerns regarding your qualifications for the role.

While you have relevant experience and technical skills, there are several areas where you fall short of our expectations. Firstly, CSS is listed under frontend, which suggests that you may not possess the necessary backend skills required for this position. We cannot compromise on this critical aspect, as it directly impacts the success of our team's projects.

Additionally, Java and C are mentioned as programming languages, but they are not typically used for backend development in this role. Your primary language is Python, which is a good start, but we expect candidates to have more relevant experience with languages like Node.js, Ruby, or PHP.

Furthermore, your resume lacks an experience section, making it difficult for us to assess the relevance and depth of your experience. We rely on concrete examples of projects you've worked on, which demonstrate your skills in backend development.

Lastly, your education background is in Information Technology, but there's no direct mention of relevant projects or work experience that showcase your expertise in backend development. This gap in experience is concerning, and we cannot overlook it.

Given these weaknesses, we're offering you a salary of 648000.0 LPA, which is within the market range. However, we must emphasize that this offer is not based on exceptional qualifications but rather on our assessment of your potential to grow into the role with adequate training and support.

We expect candidates to meet our minimum requirements, including relevant experience and technical skills. While you may have shown some capability in Python, we cannot compromise on the other aspects mentioned above. We hope you understand our position, and we're willing to discuss this further if you'd like to clarify any concerns.

"I appreciate your interest in the Backend Developer position, Athish S R. However, after reviewing your application and resume, I have some concerns that need to be addressed.

Firstly, while you list Python as your primary language, which is suitable for backend development, your experience section is lacking. There's no mention of relevant projects or work experience that demonstrate your skills in backend development. This makes it challenging to assess the depth and relevance of your experience.

Furthermore, your education section shows a degree in Information Technology, but there's no direct mention of relevant coursework or projects that showcase your ability to develop backend systems.

Additionally, I notice that Java and C are listed as programming languages, which are not typically used for backend development in this role. While you can be proficient in multiple languages, the primary language mentioned is Python, so it's unclear why these other languages were included.

Lastly, CSS is only listed under frontend skills, but the job requires backend skills. This inconsistency raises concerns about your understanding of the position and your ability to adapt to the requirements.

Considering these weaknesses, I'm afraid that we cannot offer you a salary above 14.0 LPA. While it's understandable that you may have expectations, our market analysis indicates that this is a competitive offer in line with industry standards (450,000 - 1,200,000 LPA). Unfortunately, we cannot make concessions to your requested salary of 8 LPA.

I hope you understand our position and the reasons behind our decision. If you're interested in discussing further or providing additional information that addresses these concerns, I'd be happy to hear from you."
